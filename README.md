# Crisp v1.0 Compiler
This is the first version of a programming language compiler called Crisp. You can use this code however you like, but be sure to include information about the authors. Additionally, in the "Documentation" directory you will find full Crisp documentation. Have fun researching and modifying us code. :-)
